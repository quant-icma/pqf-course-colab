    "\n",
    "- This is a group assignment and all group members should contribute.\n",
    "- Assignment Weight: 70% of the total final assessment mark.\n",
    "- YOUR COMPLETED ASSIGNMENT MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER\n",
    "THAN Thursday 6 May.\n",
    "- You should submit an electronic copy on blackboard BEFORE 12:00 p.m. on the\n",
    "submission date. Any late submissions will be dealt with according to school regulations.\n",

    "## PLAGIARISM and COLLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "All sources should be acknowledged in the text based on the Harvard referencing system. \n",
    "Students suspected of plagiarism, either of published work or work from unpublished\n",
    "sources, including the work of other students/groups, or of collusion will be dealt with\n",
    "according to University guidelines. The submitted electronic copy of your assignment will\n",
    "be put through the plagiarism detection service.\n",

    "## Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to price a number of options using the Monte Carlo method.\n",
    "We focus on plain (no early exercise), barrier and Asian options using the Black-Scholes\n",
    "Bachelier, and Heston models. You should pay particular attention to your design. \n",
    "Make sure your project is flexible enough. For example, if later you want to \n",
    "introduce additional models or payoffs then your program should be extendable\n",
    "to handle such future requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should implement the following payoffs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- European call and put\n",
    "- Up-and-Out option\n",
    "- Down-and-Out option\n",
    "- Up-and-In option\n",
    "- Down-and-In option\n",
    "- Asian call and put\n",
    "- Basket call and put\n",
    "\n",
    "with the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bachelier\n",
    "- Black-Scholes\n",
    "- Heston\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare at least two different algorithmic designs. For example, there are 3 common approaches:\n",
    "- loop over the time steps and paths (double loop)\n",
    "- loop over the time steps and process all paths together in a vectorized approach at every time step\n",
    "- loop over the paths and process a full path in each iteration  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project submission requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the github repo provided for your development. Submit electronically on Blackboard a report and code files, scripts and any notebooks with numerical results and experiments. The report should be in the range of 10 pages and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a description and justification for your design.\n",
    "- a description of your approach for testing your implementation correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking \n",
    "\n",
    "- Code design and implementation: 60%\n",
    "- Quality and relevance of tests: 20%\n",
    "- Report and documentation: 20%"
