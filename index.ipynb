    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This course provides an introduction to programming with the Python programming language using modern development environments.\n",
    "The focus is on using Python in a financial engineering context, as a tool to implement and explore derivatives models. \n",
    "We do not assume any previous programming experience, but do assume some finance and derivatives modelling knowledge. \n",
    "The course is designed as a complement to the 'Derivatives Modelling' and 'Advanced Derivatives Modelling' courses at the ICMA centre.\n",
    "Many of the hands-on consists in implementing models and conducting numerical experiments with models covered in those courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking this course, you expect to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - become with programming with Python\n",
    "  - learn software engineering skills required to develop small-scale real-world projects\n",
    "  - get your 'hands dirty' at coding financial models\n",
    "  - gain some experience at testing and debugging code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Intermediate knowledge of finance and derivatives in particular, \n",
    "at the level of an MSc in Quantitative Finance or Financial Engineering.\n",
    "The course is designed to complement the 'Derivatives Modelling' \n",
    "and 'Advanced Derivatives Modelling' courses at the ICMA centre. \n",
    "This is approximately equivalent to the level of Joshi's book,\n",
    "'The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance' or Shreve's two-volume\n",
    "'Stochastic Calculus for Finance'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The course consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 8 live introduction sessions\n",
    "  - 10 pre-recorded lectures of 1 hour and 30 minutes\n",
    "  - 6 graded individual programming assignments  \n",
    "  - 1 final group project\n",
    "  \n",
    "See [Syllabus](syllabus.html) for more details and a timetable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Material\n",
    "\n",
    "All the course material is linked within these pages as the course proceeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the notes, code examples and drill exercises with solutions, [Topics](topics/index.html)  \n",
    "  - the assignments and their solutions, [Assignments](assignments/index.html)\n",
    "  - the group project related material, [Project](project/index.html)\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Programming Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be introduced during the course to different programming environments:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Python shell\n",
    " - AWS Cloud9 Integrated Development Environment\n",
    " - Jupyter Lab and notebooks projects\n",
    " - The Scientific Python Development Environment (Spyder)\n",
    " - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is based on __individual homework assignments__ (30%), \n",
    "and a __final group project__ (70%).\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Marking](marking.html) for more details."
